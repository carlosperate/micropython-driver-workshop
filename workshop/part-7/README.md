# Part 7 - Bonus round

Congrats, you've completed the workshop!

Here are some streach goals if you have more time:

- Can you read the X/Y/Z 10-bit values combining the MSB and LSB registers?
- Can you read all the X/Y/Z registers in 1 read operation and assign them to
  class member variables?
- Can you change the measurement ranges to ±4 or ±8 g?
- Can you detect the position of a resting micro:bit?
    - Face up, face down, on its left side, on its right side...
- Can you detect when the micro:bit is being shaken?
